  <title>Potato, Spinach and Chive Frittata | Lucy Waverman</title>
  
  <!-- Anthony Aplidgiotis -->

  <!--
    The three recipe designs that inspired me are:

      Bon Appetit Magazine / Website
        - I really enjoy their visual style of webpages for recipes and how they stick to a white background and enhance the visual aspect by displaying the food with vibrant colours.

      Tasty (Webpage)
        - I was inspired by how Tasty formats the recipes into a two column layout, so that the user always has ingredients displayed to them once they open the page.

      Dribbble Recipes (Webpage)
        - Using a bold background image with some text really grabs the user's attention and I was inspired by a few posts on Dribbble in this area for my background image.

            A frittata is a flat omelette. Serve either hot or cold, cut in wedges. You can vary the fillings—try leek and bacon, smoked salmon and chives—but the method stays the same. Use your largest skillet. Smaller ones work, but the mixture takes longer to cook.

          <li>In a 10-inch (25 cm) skillet on medium-high heat, heat oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) butter. Add potatoes and sauté until brown and tender, about 8–10 minutes. Sprinkle with rosemary, season with salt and pepper and reserve. Wipe out skillet.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, wash and stem spinach. Place in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Cover and steam until spinach is tender, about 2 minutes. Place spinach in colander, cool slightly then squeeze out all excess water. Chop.</li>
          <li>Place skillet on medium-low heat, and add remaining butter. When melted, add egg mixture. Cook slowly until bottom is set, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. The top will be slightly liquid.</li>
          <li>Place skillet under preheated broiler and broil until top is just set. Turn out onto serving platter and cut in wedges. Garnish with chive flowers, if available.</li>
